#  Cryptocurrencies-and-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
# Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.


Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA : Adjust the columns in the data file and remove the unnecessary  data for PCA.

Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA : Use PCA to reduce the dimension of the data to process. 

Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means : Process the data in different clusters with Kmeans start with k=1. Then decide on the best k value.  

Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results : Create a 3-D visual in the final step. 

# Summary
Unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.
